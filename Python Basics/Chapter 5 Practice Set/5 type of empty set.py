#Here we demonstrate the difference between an empty dictionary and an empty set in Python.
# An empty set is created using the set() function, while an empty dictionary is created using curly braces {}.
s = {}
print(type(s))  # Output: <class 'dict'>

s = set()
print(type(s))  # Output: <class 'set'>
